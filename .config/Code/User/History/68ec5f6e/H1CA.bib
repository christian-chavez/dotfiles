  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy for
              classification of hepatic tumors by characterization of
              T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images using two radiomics
              approaches with machine learning models: texture analysis and
              topological data analysis using persistent homology. This study
              assessed non-contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed three-dimensional
              (3D) T1-weighted images of 150 hepatic tumors. The lesions
              included 50 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), 50 metastatic
              tumors (MTs), and 50 hepatic hemangiomas (HHs) found respectively
              in 37, 23, and 33 patients. For classification, texture features
              were calculated, and also persistence images of three types
              (degree 0, degree 1 and degree 2) were obtained for each lesion
              from the 3D MR imaging data. We used three classification models.
              In the classification of HCC and MT (resp. HCC and HH, HH and
              MT), we obtained accuracy of 92\% (resp. 90\%, 73\%) by texture
              analysis, and the highest accuracy of 85\% (resp. 84\%, 74\%)
              when degree 1 (resp. degree 1, degree 2) persistence images were
              used. Our methods using texture analysis or topological data
              analysis allow for classification of the three hepatic tumors
              with considerable accuracy, and thus might be useful when applied
              for computer-aided diagnosis with MR images.},
