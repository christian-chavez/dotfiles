Here I have collected a lot of quices, exams and general material of the courses I have taken as an undergrad. I also share insights and  general recommendations on certain subjects that are specific to the mathematics program of Yachay Tech. This collection is designed to assist fellow students in building a stronger math background."

_This post is dedicated to the mathematics students of Yachay Tech that are about to start their third year, the year at which they start to see real mathematics._


Before the begining of a new semester, it is common ammong students to ask for study material to other students that have already passed certain classes. With the newcomers in mind, I have collected below study resources of the most important courses I have taken as an undergradute mathematics student. Based on discussions with classmates and professors, I also share specific insights and  general recommendations on certain subjects of the  mathematics program of Yachay Tech. 

Among other things, you will find:
- past exams
- past quizzes
- book recommendations
- assignments
- problem sets & solutions to exercises
- links to interesting and useful sources

## Logic

Prof. Francesc Anton i Castro (Cesc). My dearest professor.

## Advanced linear algebra

I did like the course!
Prof. Raúl Manzanilla.

You will learn Matlab for sure! 

## Real analysis

Some classmates recommend to take this course before topology. In a way, topology [generalizes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXIcas22MtQ&t=308s) some of the concepts covered in this course. ()

Prof. Eusebio Ariza is a great teacher, but I didn't like zoom classes.

## Topology

My favorite subject. It is given by Prof. Wilman Brito since the  second semester 2022. I took it the same semester when I took Real Analysis, although it may be advisable to take Real Analysis first. 
Both subjects  demand a lot of time.  A good understanding of topology is essential for future courses. Wilman has always put emphasis on how important this subject is and now that I'm in my last year I can confirm that it is indeed the case.

This is an introductory course to topology, or, better said, to what is called point set topology or general topology. 

I learned topology mainly using [this lecture notes](https://www.math.toronto.edu/ivan/mat327/?resources) from the University of Toronto for the course _MAT327 • Topology_, which  has a lot of material already. I recommend to check the [lecture summaries section](https://www.math.toronto.edu/ivan/mat327/?summaries) and the [big list of problems](https://www.math.toronto.edu/ivan/mat327/docs/biglist.pdf). This lecture notes cover most of the material that  Wilman covers. 

Here are my materials:

- Past exams & quices: 
- Assignments, problem sets, 
- Book: Munkres, but other good ones are
    - Introduction to Topology by Tej Bahadur: the one that Wilman uses
    - Elementary topology problem textbook, O ya Viro: this goes very fast. use it as a reference. 
    - Topology without tears.
    - Topology by Fairchild and Ionescu: it seem to have made with functional analysis in mind
    - General topology by Engelking: I liked because it has a good discussion on the separation axioms
    - Introduction to Topology by Gamelin: the one that Wilman uses




## Measure Theory



## Abstract Algebra

Pablo Rosero taught me abstract algebra. 

## Functional Analysis

Prof. Juan Mayorga. He has his own book.
