\section{Definiones}

\begin{definition}
    Let \(f\) and \(g\) be two continuous maps from a topological space \(X\) into a topological space \(Y\). Suppose \(H \colon X\times I \to Y\) is a continuous map such that 
    \[
        \forall x\in X :\quad H(x,0) = f(x), \quad H(x,1) = g(x).
    \]
    We call \(H\) an \textbf{homotopy} from \(f\) to \(g\). We also say that \(f\) and \(g\) are \textbf{homotopic}, which will be denoted \(f\simeq g\). Maps homotopic to a constant map are said to be \textbf{null-homotopic}.
